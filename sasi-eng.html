          <br><br>You’re scrolling through Instagram, looking for the best online bakery to buy from, and you suddenly notice the phrase “DTI registered business” on the shop’s bio and a vast number of followers on their account. As you continue to canvas, you realize that several other bakeries established in 2020 also had the exact phrase on their bio. Well, you are in good hands. The shop you are viewing is original and legally operating, which means that no other business can use the registered name anywhere in the country.

          <br><br>If you think it’s hard to register an online business in a pandemic, the DTI was able to create a suitable way to register through a website. If you’re also concerned about a small start-up business having to pay taxes already, well, the DTI has a minimum income requirement for them before they are eligible. Putting all these together, registering your online business is the right thing to do. You may still be a bit hesitant but wait till you see just how much benefits you can get from taking this next step.

          <br><br>Before the pandemic, there were only about 1,700 DTI registered businesses, but as of December 2020, the DTI recorded about 88,000 new online companies. In the Philippines, the Department of Trade and Industry protects the rights of the consumers and develops policies to sustain the growth and development of the Philippine economy. Registering one’s business under DTI would allow the owner to get investors and avail of loans, which would help grow the store. Since the start of the pandemic, it was difficult for sellers to physically advertise and sell their products, so they had to resort to marketing their products online. More online stores started popping up, and many people started buying from them due to the closing of larger establishments. With the number of small online businesses emerging, it is difficult to determine whether they are trustworthy and reliable. This is why the DTI encourages owners of small online stores to register to reassure buyers that the products they are purchasing are authentic.

          <br><br>Back in the day, purchasing products online was labeled as “sketchy” or risky because it was difficult to verify if the shop was real or a scam, which is why shopping in person used to be the norm. However, online shopping became the only option of buying what we needed while also staying safe because of the lockdown. This is why the DTI encourages online businesses to register with them to boost the confidence and trust of their customers. By putting the phrase “DTI registered business” in your bio, you can assure your customers that your business is original and most likely not a scam.

          <br><br>Apart from this, let’s say that your online business grows to a point where you want to expand to a physical store to accommodate more customers, but you lack funds. Well, you’re in luck because a registered business may avail of loans to help in this process. According to DTI Secretary Ramon Lopez, one of the main benefits is the ability of these businesses, whether they are a start-up or established business, to borrow money solely for business purposes.

          <br><br>Another main concern of start-up businesses includes paying their taxes once they are registered with the DTI. To share some good news on this, the DTI and BIR mentioned that if your business earns less than Php250,000 annually, you are exempted from paying taxes. Also, only regularly operating enterprises are required to register, so if you ever find yourself selling some of your homemade baked goods as a hobby or only during your free time, then do not fret because you are not required to be DTI registered.


          <br><br>Finally, the DTI also clarified that registering a business is mainly for regulating purposes and does not automatically mean taxing you. As mentioned earlier, it is to ensure the protection of your customers and build trust on different e-commerce platforms. So, don’t be afraid to register your online business with the DTI, as it can bring your business more benefits than you can imagine!

          <br><br>Due to the pandemic, many businesses were at risk of going bankrupt because the quarantine restrictions made it difficult for stores to run. Owners had to find new ways to continue operations and generate income, and thankfully, technology opens many opportunities for business owners in the digital world. Some already sold their products online before the lockdown, while others were just getting started in e-commerce, and because of this, more online businesses popped up. More people were getting into selling their products.

          <br><br>The DTI is pushing for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to go digital. After all, it costs less to manage an online store, allowing the owner to sell to a larger market. It is easy and convenient to transact payments online, and it lessens the movement of people and their risk of catching the virus. Many consumers started getting into online shopping during the pandemic, which is why e-commerce generates a lot of income for the Philippine economy. As of August 2020, e-commerce sales reached 2.4 billion US dollars or 121.8 trillion pesos which is a lot of money, and this proves that e-commerce has a lot of potentials to be a huge thing not only today but in the years to come.

          <br><br>More SMEs entered the digital market, helping to grow the Philippine economy by generating more income. Ecommerce benefits not only the country’s economy but the sellers and consumers as well. Owners get to sell their products to a broader market, and consumers get to choose from more businesses. Plus, the registered SMEs pay taxes to the government, which contributes to the funds for government projects. We do not think about online companies and often see them as something people do to earn some cash. When we think of selling online, most of us start it off as a hobby, and we do not think of its impact on a bigger scale. Who knew that a small store could contribute so much to the Philippine economy, so it is an excellent choice to transition the business to the digital market and register it under the DTI.

          <br><br>With the unexpected rise of the online selling community due to the pandemic, more and more businesses are joining the market. This community has become a way for companies to shine despite circumstances, whether big or small. On a consumer’s note, it’s important to observe which businesses are authentic and not to be able to avoid fraud or scams. Luckily, the Department of Trade and Industry gives such companies a chance to be able to prove their authenticity by being able to register under the government. The pandemic isn’t a barrier to being able to register one’s business in the pandemic. This act doesn’t just promote consumer protection and positive e-commerce results, it also boosts the ability of a company to take legal actions to grow. Imagine how a small but significant act allows different worlds to create a better online community.
