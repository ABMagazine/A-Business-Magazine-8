        <p>
            <br><br>With 1,500 office branches and 4,400 ATMs operating under its name nationwide, BDO Unibank was the largest company in the Philippines, acquiring approximately 860.7 million U.S. dollars in 2020 alone (Statista Research Department, 2020). This being said—BDO Unibank was our group’s chosen company due to the large impact it has on the Philippine economy. Due to its large impact on the country’s economy, the changes BDO faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic were extremely prevalent.
 
          <br><br>From the horizontal analysis, it can be found that BDO continued to expand their company through the pandemic—with the assets of the company steadily growing at around 5% to 6% annually from 2018. However, with the negative financial impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, the non-controlling interests in the company’s equity decreased by 3% from the year prior. Nevertheless, the company seemed to have well-distributed growth amongst the three major accounts, with each account enjoying an increase of 5.8% in 2020.
     
          <br><br>With regards to BDO’s Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, the horizontal analysis reveals that the company’s revenue and other earnings faced a severe decline. The net profit of the company crashed by 36.03% from 2019 to 2020, producing numbers even lower than 2018. Along with this, BDO’s total comprehensive income dropped by nearly 40%, undoing the 60% growth that the company relished in the year prior. Due to the notable downturn in the company’s revenue, it can also be seen that the earnings per share diminished in 2020 by 36.43% for both basic and diluted earnings. 
           
          <br><br>In the company’s vertical analysis, it is shown that the percentages over the past 3 years did not drastically change for the Statement of Financial Position. However, the Statement of Income provides us with one very evident increase—the impairment losses. As compared to 2018 and 2019, impairment losses in 2020 took a big portion of the pie. With these losses at 14.25% whilst the previous years only had 2% to 3%, it is quite easy to analyze how the pandemic affected BDO’s performance.
           
          <br><br>In terms of profitability, the company’s rate went up overall from the years 2018-2019 but went back to their 2018 range in 2020 (most likely due to the pandemic). The next ratios measured were those of operational efficiency. In regards to the asset turnover ratio, it can be seen that the company continued to progress in using its assets to efficiently generate revenue. However, the fixed asset turnover ratio was seen to worsen in 2020, this was most likely due to the unforeseen circumstances that the pandemic brought upon the company. Lastly, the ratios that determine financial health showed that the company is slowly lessening its debt in comparison to its assets and equity.
           
          <br><br>Though the COVID-19 pandemic took a major toll on BDO’s overall performance last 2020, the company seemed to be doing fairly well as there were no major effects on the company’s assets, liabilities, and equity. On the other hand—with regards to the firm’s revenue—BDO witnessed a severe decrease as the pandemic seemed to set them back to generate similar numbers as in 2018. With all things considered, now that BDO is more knowledgeable of the issues brought about by the pandemic, we believe that the company may be more prepared to tackle these setbacks in the future and eventually rebuild its growth.
