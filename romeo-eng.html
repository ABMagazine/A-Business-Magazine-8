            <br><br>Taking the world by storm, the COVID-19 pandemic drastically altered the way we go about our day-to-day lives as teenagers in the 21st century, particularly our purchasing behavior. With quarantine restrictions not permitting anyone under the age of 18 to leave their homes, many businesses and stores did not have enough consumers to generate a significant number of sales and were forced to shut down.
 
          <br><br>In fact, in an Economic Impact Report done by Yelp in September of 2020, there were around 163,735 businesses that announced their business closures on the platform. From this number, approximately 60% of those were found to be permanent closures, revealing that 97,966 businesses were shut down in the US alone (Sundaram, 2020).
     
          <br><br>Unfortunately, the fashion industry was not exempt from the challenges brought about by COVID-19. In December 2020, McKinsey & Company calculated that the global fashion industry’s revenue was expected to fall 93% from 2019 to 2020 (Fraser, 2020). However, businesses using e-commerce platforms have been discovered to consistently outperform those that do not. By August 2020, these businesses were seen to have a 35% higher trade average as compared to December 2019. 
           
          <br><br>E-commerce has become the main gateway to buying your closet wants and needs as it allows you to browse for products from the comfort and safety of your own bedroom. Digital shopping platforms have not only done this, but they have also allowed businesses to better connect with their customers during these trying times. With 91.9% of US businesses with 100+ employees spending an average of $250-$350 dollars a day on social media as a means of marketing, companies are doing their best to maintain steady growth in sales despite the pandemic. Through switching to online markets and investing more time and money into their internet presence, these stores were able to adapt to the tribulations being faced by the world.
           
          <br><br>With the COVID-19 virus being the third leading cause of death all of last year according to the CDC, despite being mandatory, staying home became the most difficult challenge that the world had to face. “How would the economy survive?” “How would we buy our daily necessities?” These, along with many other questions, were the concerns of people around the globe. Our routines were forced to change. Our movements and our everyday schedules were now limited to the 4 corners of our homes. With the new quarantine procedures put in place, there were limited options when it came to shopping—especially for teenagers.
           
          <br><br>For their safety and the safety of others, purchasing their apparel through a simple tap on their phones was more favorable in comparison to going out as it would lessen the risk of virus transmission. From the simple purchasing procedure to the easily accessible reviews, online shopping platforms have proved themselves to be the best method for purchasing your wants and needs during this time. 

          <br><br>“But what did businesses do?” Because of the ever-changing situation that COVID-19 has brought upon the world, businesses in the fashion industry have had to act quickly to keep up with their consumers' wants and needs. One way businesses were able to do this was to keep up with social media.

          <br><br>Social Media apps, most notably TikTok and Instagram, skyrocketed clothing trends. From free-form shapes with bright patterns to more minimalist designs, much of the clothes that make up the staples of an average teen’s wardrobe nowadays can be found on these apps. As days go by we gradually see more and more apps turn into marketplaces. The ends of tweet threads contain ad after ad, TikTok and YouTube have become a place of brand deals, and Instagram has even created a marketplace section on the app. This growth in the marketplace has allowed everyone to see what the latest trends are, and the fashion industry has made the most of it. 

          <br><br>Generation Z is known as the virtual generation. We’ve grown alongside rapidly developing technology, and this reflects on our everyday interaction between others and ourselves. With teenagers of this generation spending an average of 2 hours and 43 minutes on social media, 85% find products that pique their interest through their social media. As the generation of technology slowly becomes the main consumer market, companies are catering to the demographic through investing more in social media platforms via advertisements released using various algorithms, to make sure that their product reaches the phone screen of someone that has an interest in the product.

          <br><br>Though the COVID-19 lockdowns played a major role in the boom in sales of fashion e-commerce, the growth does not seem like it is stopping anytime soon. Many consumers have expressed their preference towards online shopping due to its easy usage, and have mentioned that they are planning to continue using e-commerce platforms even after the pandemic.

          <br><br>Though the pandemic presented our world with numerous losses, e-commerce platforms, in a way, prevented many further casualties. They’ve given our generation a means to connect to others from the convenience of our own homes. The pandemic serves as an example of these platforms' adjustments and growth; the e-commerce platform is an ever-evolving platform that will continue to fit the newest and most difficult circumstances our world faces.
