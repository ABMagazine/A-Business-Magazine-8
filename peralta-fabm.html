        <p>
          <br><br>The Philippines' largest telecommunications provider, PLDT, saw record-high service revenue due to increased demand for internet services during the coronavirus outbreak. According to the horizontal analysis of PLDT’s financial sheet, total assets climbed from PHP 482,750 in 2018 to PHP 575,846 in 2020, indicating that the company has been expanding, notably with the growth in demand for internet connectivity to enable work-from-home setups and online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.

          <br><br>Due to this rise in demand, the acquisition of inventory and investments rose as well, causing the total liabilities and equity of the PLDT company to increase from PHP 482,750 in 2018 to PHP 575,846 in 2020. With the predicted spike of in-home internet usage during this pandemic, improving and boosting PLDT service has been critical to avoiding network saturation and accommodating data traffic from regularly used social media and streaming services. With this, PLDT should continue to improve its services and double its domestic network capacity to serve both residential and corporate consumers, as well as to accommodate the anticipated increase in its subscriber base.

          <br><br>Given the growth of mobile internet usage and demand for data connectivity during the pandemic, the company was able to sell its services more in 2020 in comparison to the previous years. Based on the vertical analysis of PLDT’s comprehensive income statement, there was a continuous increase in their sales and revenue (from PHP 164,752 in 2018 to PHP 181,004 in 2020), which resulted in a high percentage of the company’s net income (from 11% in 2018 to 13% in 2020). A factor as to why the company’s income changed is the behavior of their operating expenses wherein their expenses went from 29% in 2018 to 24% in 2019. However, the company may have failed to cut its expenses in the following year, having PHP 126,817 under the operating expenses in 2020. 

          <br><br>Unlike most companies, PLDT Inc. didn’t see drastic, negative changes in performance in 2020. Financial Ratios can be divided according to the company’s profitability, operation efficiency, and financial health. Below is an analysis for each of the aforementioned financial ratio types. 
  
          <br><br>As a whole, PLDT Inc.’s profitability is steady, indicating that there is a substantial amount of income generated from the company’s assets and capital. The company’s net profit margin peaks in 2020 at 13.58%, the highest income for that year. The thumbprint net profit margin is 10%, proving that PLDT’s return on sales has been excellent and steady throughout the three years. A return on equity is generally considered to be good if it is above 15%. The company goes well over this standard, especially in 2020, where it reaches 20.83%. 
  
          <br><br>Operational efficiency refers to how the company uses its assets to generate sales, PLDT being fair in terms of its efficiency. PLDT’s asset turnover is steady, ranging from 0.33-0.34. The company utilizes its assets enough for every peso under assets to generate 0.33 - 0.34 of net sales. On the other hand, PLDT’s fixed assets turnover fluctuates due to the varying values of net sales and PPE. Net sales for each year have been somewhat consistent however, the year 2020 saw a significant increase in the possession of fixed assets. PLDT’s inventory turnover that ranges from 17.18-19.98 is more than excellent.
  
          <br><br>Financial health can be divided into solvency and liquidity which refers to the company’s ability to pay long-term and current liabilities, respectively. PLDT’s debt exceeds its capital the most in 2020 3.81 times. This is a negative implication because this is an indication of the company sourcing its finances from debt. PLDT’s debt ratio is low and consistent, indicating that its assets are not financed by debt. The higher the current ratio, the easier it is for a company to pay for current liabilities with current assets. PLDT’s low current ratio indicates that current liabilities exceed current assets, making them unable to pay for their short-term expenses.

          <br><br>As a whole, PLDT Inc.’s profitability is steady, indicating that there is a substantial amount of income generated from the company’s assets and capital. Operational efficiency refers to how the company uses its assets to generate sales. Overall, PLDT is fairly efficient in generating sales with its assets. PLDT Inc.’s financial health is on the line because of its inability to pay for both its long and short-term liabilities.
  
          <br><br>Overall, PLDT Inc. showed positive results from 2018 to 2020 given the continuous rise in its sales and income. However, the company was put under a lot of debt due to its inability to meet its long and short-term obligations. Thus, the group advises the PLDT’s top management to focus on the company’s liquidity in order to improve its financial health.
