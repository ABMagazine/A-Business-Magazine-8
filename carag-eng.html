            <br><br>Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.
 
          <br><br>Remember when our alarm clocks used to signal a new day of work? When we would muster up the courage to get out of bed, ready ourselves for the next 8 or 10 hours, and make our way to the office? Now, imagine that whole process again, except all you do is make your way to the desk across your room instead of going out to the office. For some, this cycle has gone on for more than a year. Working from a regular 9 AM-to-5 PM job to a never-ending 24-hour shift in the comforts of your home has never been easy, but the lockdown was something that was needed in order to save lives, and it has worked! For a long time, putting cities under quarantine seemed like the best way to go, but it can only go so far, can’t it? Many business owners wonder “where do we go from here?”. This is when DTI and DOLE’s interim guidelines on workplace prevention come in.

     
          <br><br>With some Filipino businesses finding it difficult to have their employees work from home, the interim guidelines have helped in allowing them to come to work while still being able to keep safe from COVID-19. Although this has greatly prevented the spread of the virus in the workplace, it has also impacted the way businesses operate and finance their funds. With this in mind, one has to wonder: Are DTI and DOLE’s interim guidelines friend, or foe?

           
          <br><br>You can already tell that the quarantine and the lockdowns that the government implemented took a toll on the Philippines' working environment. The country’s GDP and employment rate was like a boulder falling down a mountain, dropping by 9.5% and 16% respectively. You could say that not everything in the country went downhill, some aspects actually went uphill like inflation and debt. Those don’t really sound like the good aspects to be rising but sadly they rose by  4.7% and 26.7% respectively. So some numbers are getting higher and some are getting lower, who cares? Well, these numbers are without a doubt important because these mean that everything just got harder, and more expensive for both buyers and sellers of products and services.
           
          <br><br>With the pandemic ongoing, how do “us” the people move around or work? Guidelines were implemented by workforces and have been placed around the Philippines. So, what are these guidelines that help prevent and control these workplaces and you may wonder: How do businesses run? What must they follow? Here are some:

          <br><br>- Employers should give staggered meal schedules for the employees.

          <br><br>- Employers are highly encouraged to provide sick leave benefits, medical insurance coverage, pay allowance, for COVID-19 RT-PCR test confirmed employees or close contacts made to undergo a 14-day quarantine.

          <br><br>- All employees experiencing COVID-19 symptoms must take the RT-PCR test.

          <br><br>- All employees must wear face masks and observe social distance from each other.

          <br><br>We follow these guidelines since we need to earn and live a “normal life” as much as possible. It may seem very easy to follow these workplace guidelines, but it is not. Some employees tend to work even if they are not feeling well. They hide their symptoms to keep on working, which should not be the case! This happens because we are a third-world country and they need the money. Oh gosh! If they say anything about their symptoms then they will be banned from working for 14 days, but to stop the spread of COVID-19 virus, we should take a medical leave. Also, employers are told to submit monthly COVID-19 reports to DOLE to ensure health protocols are being done in the workplace.

          <br><br>Sometimes in life, we’re forced to make choices.  Weighing out our pros and cons, making a decision— they have never been easy. In this time of the pandemic, we’ve had to face some of the toughest decisions we’ve had to make since this time held so much uncertainty. If this time has taught us anything, it’s that we have to make sacrifices for our safety and the safety of other people, and business owners had to learn this the hard way. DTI and DOLEs Interim Guidelines were proved useful in limiting the spread of the virus, but how did this affect businesses from a financial and operational perspective?


          <br><br>Wholesale and retail trade sales were most affected by the pandemic, as they either lost sales (to the point of needing to close) or gained sales (from servicing a special demand). Businesses who’ve gained sales, however, do not outweigh the number of businesses who’ve gone, well, out of business. It cannot be denied that the pandemic AND its associated containment measures prompted a sharp decline in sales for many companies. With the circulation of money slowing down from a lower demand for products and services and a lower supply of labor (aka a lack of employees), most companies had to rely on retained profit and/or their own funds to make it through the lockdown. Some even had to borrow money from relatives or informal moneylenders! For business owners, it’s been a tough race for survival the past year, so when you get to the topic of dealing with how their whole company operates? Oh boy, that’s a lot to unpack.

          <br><br>The pandemic has forced many companies to change the way they run, all for the safety of their employees. Many had their working hours reduced, meaning their salaries were reduced as well. New arrangements for regular and part-time workers were also implemented in order to keep work going while complying with the Interim Guidelines. Examples of these arrangements are splitting the employees into smaller groups and making them report to the office alternately, or just having to fully adjust to an online setup when the hybrid strategy was too difficult to execute.


          <br><br>Come 2021 however, vaccines came into play, and hope shone for so many people. It was as if there was a ring of light and an aura of optimism around the idea of vaccines that just made anyone who said it anticipate a light at the end of a tunnel. Because of this, companies started calling back their employees to regularly report to the office. Now, we have to remember that despite the news of vaccines being made available in the country, that did not mean that the rate of COVID cases was decreasing. In fact, in the month of March, cities saw the infections spread even faster, and the Philippines? It saw a record-breaking rise in cases for days. Most say that this was due to the excitement of companies and people in general, but who could blame them? Unfortunately though, the rapid rise resulted in another enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), forcing businesses back to a hybrid or fully online setup. The line between whether the pandemic or the Interim Guidelines have caused businesses to suffer so much has become more and more blurred, but at the end of day, we wouldn’t have these guidelines without the pandemic, right?

          <br><br>Now that we come to the end… 

          <br><br>It’s time to answer the awaited question, “Is DTI and DOLEs interim guidelines, friend or foe?” Well, it is both a friend and a foe. It is a friend to the health and safety of the people of the Philippines, but a foe to businesses. It may have somewhat controlled the spread of the COVID-19 virus, but it led to employees reducing working hours and employers reducing salaries which in turn took a toll on our country’s economy. Not knowing when we’ll ever go back to our old normal, we keep hoping to wake up to a new day with the virus not lurking at every corner wherever we go. This is what we need to wake up to the next time our alarm clocks go off.
