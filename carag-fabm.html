<!--BODY(ARTICLE)-->
  <div class="bodae">

        <p>
           <br><br>Universal Robina Corporation engages in the manufacture and distribution of consumer food products. The activities of Universal Robina Corporation operate on four main segments. First segment is the ‘Branded Consumer Food Products’ where it manufactures and distributes salty snacks, chocolates, candies, biscuits, bakery products, beverages, instant noodles, pasta and tomato-based products. Second segment is the ‘Agro-Industrial Products’ where it produces and distributes animal health products, animal feeds, glucose, and soya bean products. Third segment is the ‘Commodity Food Products’ where it refines sugar and flour, manufactures pasta, and develops renewable energy. Lastly, the fourth segment is the ‘Corporate Business Segment’ where it includes the bonds and securities investment and fund sourcing activities. 

            <br><br>Besides Universal Robina being the largest branded consumer food and beverage product company in the Philippines, it’s a company that has a strong and loyal consumer base and wide distribution network. Since the company is deemed by the public to be successful, the group hopes to see the same reflection when analyzing the financial records. 

            <br><br>In the vertical analysis, it can be seen that throughout 2018, 2019, and 2020, the net income and earnings per share of Universal Robina continued to rise. Although, the 2020 comprehensive income of the corporation is not looking too good. A big dip occurred in its values which could have been caused by the sudden fluctuations in cumulative translation adjustments, unrealized loss on cash flow hedge, unrealized gain on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and remeasurement gains on defined benefit plans. The net income in 2020 increased. This could be because of the significant decrease of other income net under operating income. In 2019, from a finance cost of 1 million to a 780k cost in 2020, it can be one of the leading reasons as to why the net income in 2020 increased. Although, it is recommended for the corporation to work on its equity to be able to recover from the 2020 decrease of comprehensive income. 

            <br><br>It can be seen through the horizontal analysis that the increase in total assets and total liabilities and equity for 2019 to 2020 was not as high as the increase in 2018 to 2019.  In 2019 to 2020, the total assets and total liabilities and equity only increased by 4.47%, but in 2018 to 2019 it increased by 11.00%. The big dip in 2019 to 2020 can be due to the biological assets, gap between liabilities and equity, and values in current assets. This may be the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Universal Robina. It affected the company’s labor force and resourcing, which could be the reason as to why the assets, liabilities and equity greatly fluctuated. In 2018 to 2019, the corporation's equity was higher than their liabilities. In 2019 to 2020, the corporation’s liabilities were higher than their equity which can be due to the long term debts going to a high and equity reserve going to a low. The cause of these debts could be the government implementations on businesses due to the pandemic, which stopped the normal motion of the company. In 2018 to 2019, the current assets went as high as 19.18% but in 2019 to 2020, it dropped to 1.11%. This drop could be due to the big dip in biological assets, which refers to the assets that are living things like trees, animals, etc, and the cash equivalents going down. It’s also good to note that in 2018 to 2019, there were more current assets compared to non current assets. But in 2019 to 2020, there were more non current assets than current assets. This is bad because the 2019 to 2020 current liabilities went extremely high. A recommendation is for Universal Robina to improve their current assets and work on their current liabilities because that’s the part that’s pulling them down the most for the year 2019 to 2020. 

            <br><br>Through the use of Financial Ratios, a company’s profitability, operational efficiency, and financial health can be determined. In terms of profitability, Universal Robina has been able to increase their Gross Profit Margin, Net Profit Margin, and Return on Equity bit by bit throughout the last 3 years. This shows an improvement in their control over its costs, a decrease in their interest expenses or increase in their income as a percentage of sales, and a rise in the net income generated by the company’s capital. All in all, an increase in every profitability ratio shows that the company has become more and more profitable over the years. 

            <br><br>Unlike its profitability aspect, the operational efficiency of Universal Robina is quite difficult to determine from face value. Its Asset Turnover gradually decreased over the years, which means that the company’s efficiency in regards to the use of assets has decreased. The Fixed Asset Turnover ratio shows positive results, however. It can then be assumed that their fixed assets have generated sales more efficiently. Although a decrease in ratios is seen again in the Inventory Turnover, signifying that the rate at which the company sells out its inventory becomes slower and slower. To conclude, although Universal Robina is able to generate sales by using their fixed assets efficiently, there is a need for improving the utilization of assets as a whole. This may explain why the inventory turnover has decreased over the years. In general, the company will need to increase their operational efficiency moving forward.

            <br><br>Financial health aspect is very important in a business and unfortunately, it is seen that Universal Robina’s financial health has decreased in the last 3 years. The Current Ratio decreased slowly over time, resulting in the company having only 1.83 times more assets than their liabilities. The Debt to Equity of Universal Robina has also decreased consistently since 2018. It shows that the company had more debt than equity in that year. This is also similar to the trend identified in their Debt Ratios. Even with the increase of current assets, the decrease of the ratios shows that Universal Robina is struggling financially and are unable to pay their debts as fast as their previous years. For the company to be stable, the company must focus on improving the financial health for the future of the business.
