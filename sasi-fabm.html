        <p>
          <br><br>Jollibee Foods Corporation is the largest fast-food chain brand in the Philippines, with over 1,400 stores and branches in other parts of Asia, North America, and Europe. The nature of this business is to serve great-tasting food such as their famous Chickenjoy and Yumburger while also bringing joy to their customers. Like all the large businesses in the country, Jollibee suffered many losses due to fewer sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. We selected this company because we wanted to understand the financial impact of the lockdowns and stay-at-home orders on one of our favorite fast-food chains and the food industry as a whole.

          <br><br>As written in the statement of comprehensive income, the company’s gross sales for 2020 was 124.5 pesos million while its gross profit was 13.5 million pesos which are 10.91% of the total revenue. They spent 26.4 million pesos that year on expenses which covered 21.19%. Jollibee Foods Corporation spent more in 2020 compared to 2018 and 2019, which, along with their low sales, contributed to its net loss. Additionally, their profitability ratios from 2018-2020 slowly declined to a negative value, proving even further that they became less profitable. Before the pandemic, Jollibee Foods Corporation was a prominent business earning hundreds of millions in 2018 and 2019, and it was only in 2020 when they suffered a net loss of 12.6 million pesos. 
  
          <br><br>Due to the huge net loss that Jollibee Foods Corporation experienced in 2020, it is clear that the pandemic has severely affected the company and the entire fast-food industry. This is because a significant number of branches closed down, thus leading to a decrease in sales. Another reason for this is the increase in liabilities of the company from 63 million in 2018 to 142 million in 2019, which can be seen in the Statement of Financial Position. One big decision that affected this is the acquisition of American brand coffee, The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. This decision was even recognized in the key matter of 2019 as it required significant attention due to the acquired assets and liabilities which specifically are property, equipment, and trademark. Lease liabilities caused the increase since the company opted to avail of the short-term option. This continued to 2020 as well with a 7 million peso gap from the previous year. The increase in liabilities of Jollibee affected their financial health and contributed to a high debt to equity ratio and a current ratio of 2 and 1.4 respectively. This means that the company may not have enough assets to cover its liabilities and also proves that its liabilities exceed the capital. Along with the increase in liabilities, it seems like Jollibee also tried expanding during the pandemic by investing more in their assets. In 2018, Jollibee had around ​​113.9 million pesos worth of assets which then increased even further in the next few years with it amounting to 187.3 million pesos in 2019 and 210.8 million pesos in 2020. 

          <br><br>The pandemic negatively affected Jollibee Foods Corporation due to the decrease in gross sales and increase in liabilities and expenses. Due to the lockdown, Jollibee had to close over 200 branches to avoid any more losses, but despite all this, the company is still doing its best to continue serving its customers. Jollibee Foods Corporation suffered a lot due to COVID-19, and though they were able to recover some losses incurred, it will take time for them to recover from it fully.
