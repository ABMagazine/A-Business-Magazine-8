<!--BODY(ARTICLE)-->

        <p>
            <br><br>Philippine Airlines (PAL) is a well-known Filipino airline company, and it has been serving the Filipino people since 1941. As a result, PAL is Southeast Asia's oldest and most experienced airline. Philippine Airlines is now a privately owned airline controlled by PAL Holdings, one of the Philippines' largest conglomerates. According to CNN Philippines, last September 2021, PAL officially filed for bankruptcy as COVID cases continued to rise rapidly. 

            <br><br>In the horizontal analysis, the year 2019 had the highest total liabilities among 2018 to 2020. This increase may have been due to the extensive spending in 2019, possibly for expansion; consequently, the debt went up due to the bills to pay. Despite this, PAL had the highest net sales and assets among the three years. The Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) in 2019 heavily increased from 2018; this could mean that the company was planning to expand shortly, a one-time cost such as new planes and technology. The equity from 2018 to 2020 progressively decreased, from ₱10,687.00 to ₱4,898.00 to -₱68,107.00. This decrease is a tremendous financial risk, as the equity keeps dropping every year. The company should not rely on its equity to purchase PPE and pay off its debts, as this is just the owner’s investment. Ideally, long-term assets and liabilities should be paid using the company’s cash. 

            <br><br>From the values derived from the vertical analysis, it is seen that the net income from 2020 has decreased significantly compared to 2019 & 2018. Several accounts have contributed to this decline: cost of goods sold, gross profit, and operating income, to name a few. These accounts were already within the negative values in the previous years, but in 2020, the numbers seemed to have nosedived. Another major contribution to this decline is the COVID pandemic which led to the shutdown of flights and the decrease in passengers availing for this service. Furthermore, the equity in 2020 was at -29.88%, a considerable decrease compared to the 1.54% in 2019. A negative equity account indicates that the company incurred financial losses causing them to borrow money from stockholders’ investments and other investors. 

            <br><br>In 2020, despite PAL’s struggle to earn enough revenue, the company continued to incur operating costs. Consequently, they had to find ways to pay for their obligations that eventually affected their profit. With this, the costs outweighed their profit, which contributed to their net loss.  Under the net profit margin ratios, the years 2018-2019 had consistent percentages. However, in the year 2020, the company’s profitability ratio has plummeted significantly. With the low value of the profitability ratio, this is a clear indication of unhealthy financial conditions. 

            <br><br>Based on the inventory turnover and asset turnover which are the main determinants of being able to see the operational efficiency of Philippine Airlines, the company has been consistent from 2018-2019. Although, in 2020 they have experienced an extreme drop from these 2 years under both inventory and asset turnover. This would imply that in the year 2020, there was no considerable demand for their services and goods. Additionally, the company is not as efficient anymore in generating sales from their asset base. Once again, it may have been heavily caused by the COVID pandemic. 

            <br><br>In 2018 the debt ratio was 96.23%, meanwhile, in 2019, it became 100.04%, and finally, in 2020, it decreased to 76.99%. In 2018 and 2019, we assume that PAL was expanding; therefore, it would need loans to forgo. Lastly, in 2020, the debt ratio has decreased significantly from 100.04% to 76.99%. This decrease assumes that not many of their facilities were in use. Additionally, many employees were laid off because of the limited flights available caused by the lockdown. However, even with the debt reduction, the net sales were still at the lowest they had ever been. From 2018-2020, the net profit margin has decreased from -2.88% to -6.67% to ​​-129.94%. This decrease implies that the company has had difficulty converting sales into profit which is a huge loss for Philippines Airlines. With the overall decreasing performance of PAL from 2018-2020, Philippine Airlines has finally decided to file for bankruptcy in September 2021.
