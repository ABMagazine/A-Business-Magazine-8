            <br><br>Living in one of the most vulnerable sectors of the Philippines has become more difficult than ever—especially for Leia, a 16-year-old girl living with her mother and 23 other siblings, nieces, and nephews in the slums of Tondo, Manila. Prior to the pandemic, Leia’s mother ran a small store within her community to be able to feed her family. However, as people start to lose their jobs, income within the area stops flowing—putting their business and their whole family at risk. In critical times like these, people like Leia and her family have become more fearful of hunger rather than the virus itself. This COVID-19 crisis has made many citizens and leaders beg for one question to be asked and answered––what can be done to provide relief?
 
          <br><br>The Philippine government’s response to aid struggling citizens like Leia are the Bayanihan Acts—a series of laws designed to alleviate displaced Filipinos from the effects of the pandemic. The government’s agenda is to reallocate national funds in an effort to combat the virus and its detrimental economic effects. This reallocation means underscoring the needs of those without a steady, sufficient income; and in a country like this, those people correspond to a significantly large fraction of the population. In line with the truth that the Philippines is home to 17.6 million people living under the poverty line, it is crucial now more than ever to provide aid to low-income families residing in some of the poorest and most congested areas of the country. Yet, due to the continued disimprovement of struggling citizens, it only makes sense to question whether or not these funds are merely adequate for the Filipino families who were severely hit by the COVID-19 outbreak and disparity of the country’s economy. 
     
          <br><br>Under the Bayanihan Acts, the Bayanihan 1, also known as the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, provided frontline workers with personal protection equipment, accommodations, and risk allowances, as well as more employees to assist them in their daily duties. Subsequently, the Bayanihan Act 2, also known as The Bayanihan to Recover as One Act was implemented by the government as a continuation of the Bayanihan Act 1 in the hopes to mainly aid the pandemic-hit sectors, as well as affected businesses and consumers. As of 2020, more than 41,000 families have received financial support through the emergency subsidy program (ESP) provided under the Act. With this, the government will be able to maintain and expand their capacity in assisting Filipinos to rise above the adversity brought on by the pandemic. 
           
          <br><br>To say that government intervention is essential at a time of crisis would be an understatement. While the Philippine government’s approach seems somewhat rational, it isn’t shocking that this help doesn’t go a long way. While this law is implemented with good intentions in mind, it doesn’t provide enough to help marginalized citizens stay afloat.
           
          <br><br>In addition to the insufficiency of financial aid, several other factors play into the downfall of the program. One of the most notable being corruption as a result of the entrustment of distribution to Local Government Units (LGUs). Not to mention, the mass suspension of 89 barangay chiefs for this very reason. Second is the failure for some barangays to follow the supposed distribution process which entails officials going to residents’ houses to hand out aid. Instead, several people flocked to distribution sites in crowds, defeating the prioritized intention of containing the virus. Third, the slow distribution of ayuda left several families waiting for their share of funds even months after the intended distribution. Fourth, issues in terms of identifying beneficiaries. A government-created list of the poorest families in the country served as the basis for those in need of assistance. The number of families on this list did not correspond to the actual number of impoverished families.
           
          <br><br>The deficiency of the Bayanihan To Recover As One Act in terms of aiding the daily lives of citizens is more than evident. However, the law’s shortcomings in terms of aiding small businesses is a completely different conversation that needs to be shed light on.

          <br><br>Regardless of Bayanihan 2’s provision of loan payment extensions, low-interest loans for MSMEs (micro, small, and medium enterprises), and extended grace periods for utilities and rent, no more substantial alleviation has been provided as thousands of local businesses continue to shut down. Unsurprising is the government’s slowness to action. This factor continues to remain one of the people’s biggest enemies. Only 2,000 MSME loans were granted, short of the DTI’s goals of granting 15,000.

          <br><br>Despite the inadequacy of the Bayanihan Act 2 and its funds for low-income households, the act still provides good intentions for certain sectors in the country. As mentioned, the measures of the Bayanihan Act 2 are implemented to stimulate and progress the recovery of the country’s economy from the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Undoubtedly, the government, Senate and House of Representatives aimed its provisions mainly towards the continuity of businesses such as financial institutions and utility companies, as well as affected sectors like the agriculture, healthcare and education sector. Given these, the government’s efforts in sustaining the growth of the Philippine economy will still continue to be recognizable and perceptible.

          <br><br>With approximately 10 million Filipinos losing their jobs and livelihoods amidst the COVID-19 lockdown, it is more important than ever for the government to provide immediate response. Needless to say, in order to rewrite the stories of those such as Leia, there must be more compassion from Filipino leaders. Without the sufficient and adequate support of the government, the country will continue to digress from its hopes of an economic recovery.
